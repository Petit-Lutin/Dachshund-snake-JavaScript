# Snake game with Dachshund ("sausage dog") in JavaScript

## Starting point

I wanted to make a small game based on the Snake from Nokia 3310.
This tutorial using canvas with colored squares in JavaScript was my starting point : https://github.com/CodeExplainedRepo/Snake-JavaScript

My goal is not to copy/paste the code of this tutorial : I want to replace the snake with a dachshund (sausage dog).
My first problem was to separate the head, the body (belly), and the tail, because I wanted that only the belly of the dog could grow.  

## To do
- [x] Find a way to separate head, body and tail of the "dog-snake"
- [ ] Creating the sprites (using Krita or The Gimp)
- [ ] Track the direction of the "dog-snake" to display the correct sprite
- [ ] Clean the code
