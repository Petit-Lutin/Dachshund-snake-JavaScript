# Snake game with dog in JavaScript

I want to make a small game based on the Snake from Nokia 3310.
This tutorial was my starting point : https://github.com/CodeExplainedRepo/Snake-JavaScript

Now I have to rewrite it differently in order to have an illustrated "snake" rather than colored squares.
